# Cotton Plant Disease Detection with Transfer Learning (DenseNet121)

Welcome to the "Cotton Plant Disease Detection" project, which utilizes deep learning, specifically DenseNet121, to detect diseases in cotton plants. This project showcases the application of transfer learning in the field of computer vision.

## Overview

Disease detection in crops is critical for ensuring healthy yields and preventing crop loss. This project focuses on using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to automatically identify and classify diseases in cotton plants.

## Tech Stack

This project is implemented using a diverse range of technologies:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for deep learning model development and training.

- **HTML/JavaScript/CSS**: Build a web-based user interface for interacting with the model.

- **Python**: Primary programming language for deep learning and data processing.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for model development, training, and evaluation.
- `webapp/`: Contains the web interface for interacting with the model.
- `model/`: The pre-trained DenseNet121 model for transfer learning.
- `data/`: Dataset used for training and testing.
- `app.py`: Main script for the web application.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application to access the web interface.
4. Upload images of cotton plants to get disease detection results.

## Model

This project employs transfer learning with the DenseNet121 architecture, which is a powerful deep learning model known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned for cotton plant disease detection.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Amazon EC2, making it accessible online.

## Contributing

Contributions and improvements to the project are encouraged. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
